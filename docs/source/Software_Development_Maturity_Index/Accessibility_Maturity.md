## Accessibility

Accessibility is often overlooked as a development priority. It may be hard for developers without a disability to conceptualize needing or using accessibility features, but itâ€™s easy to find examples that may be possible for anyone to imagine. For example, some software developers developed repetitive stress injuries and turned to speech-to-text aids to continue working in their profession. Beyond the general necessity, adhering to accessibility standards is often a hard requirement for software solutions in many state systems.
