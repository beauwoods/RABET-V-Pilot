# RABET-V Security Services Architectural Maturity (SSAM) Index

The SSAM index provides scores which indicate how well the product's architecture is built to provide the security service. This is a measure of the reliability of the security service and how isolated the security service is from other system changes. These maturity scores are measured during the RABET-V Architecture Review. See [Architecture Review Methodology](../Activities/Architecture_Review_Methodology.md) for more information on this maturity index.

## Maturity Score Ranges

Maturity scores are provided for each of the 10 security services. A green, yellow, and red range is provided for each area to indicate optimal, acceptable, and unacceptable score ranges.

The range values will be set by the Verification Authority and may be overwritten by individual states who wish to establish their own ranges of optimal, acceptable, and unacceptable.

*There are no ranges established for the pilot program.*

**Green:** TBD

**Yellow:** TBD

**Red:** TBD

## SSAM Model

The SSAM Index provides maturity scores across two streams.
