# Style Guide

This is a style guide for producing documents for *RABET-V* using *GitHub Flavored Markdown* (GFM).

## Formatting Conventions

| Convention | Explanation                                                                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Italics    | Introduces new terms and indicates emphasis.                                        |
| Bold       | ??                                                                                  |
| `monospace`| Indicates identifiers used in source code.                                          |

## Abbreviations/Acronyms

Acronyms should generally be spelled out the first time they appear, as in: "Unified Modeling Language (UML)." After the acronym has been defined, you should generally use the acronym only (not the whole term, unless it makes more sense contextually to use the whole term). Spell out the acronym the first time it appears in a document (i.e. a Markdown file)

## Lines/breaking

Do not use line breaks for formatting purposes.

## Lists

- Start with sentence case
- Do not add a period at the end of the line, even if it is a complete sentence
- List items should be treated as separate items and should not be strung together with punctuation or conjunctions

## Others

- See https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md
