# RABET-V Security Services Capability Maturity (SSCM) Index 

The SSCM Index provides a set of maturity scores for each of the ten security services. The score ranges from 0 to 3, where 3 is the best. 

The scores are based on how well the product revision meets the security requirements set forth for each security service. These requirements are built from the [Security Best Practices for Non-Voting Election Technology](https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Security-Best-Practices-Non-Voting-Election-Tech-Singles-19-Nov.pdf). 


## Maturity Scores

* **Score < 1.0:** Little or basic security capabilities
* **1.0 <= Score < 2.0:** Intermediate security capabilities
* **2.0 <= Score <= 3.0:** Advanced security capabilities
