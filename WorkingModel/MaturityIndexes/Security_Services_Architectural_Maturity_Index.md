# RABET-V Security Services Architectural Maturity (SSAM) Index 

The SSAM index provides scores which indicate how well the product's architecture is built to provide the security service. This is a measure of the reliability of the security service and how isolated the security service is from other system changes. These maturity scores are measured during the RABET-V Architecture Review. See [Achitecture Review Methodology](../Activities/Architecture_Review_Methodology.md) for more information on this maturity index.
