# RABET-V Software Development Maturity (SDM) Index

The Software Development Maturity Index score is measured by the RABET-V Process Review activity and indicates the maturity of the provider's software assurance processes. The RABET-V SDM score is based on the [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](www.owaspsamm.org).

## Maturity Score Ranges
Maturity scores are provided for each of the 17 software development areas (15 SAMM plus Usability and Accessibility). A green, yellow, and red range is provided for each area to indicate optimal, acceptable, and unacceptable score ranges. 

The range values will be set by the Verification Authority and may be overwritten by individual states who wish to establish their own ranges of optimal, acceptable, and unacceptable. 

*There are no ranges established for the pilot program.*
