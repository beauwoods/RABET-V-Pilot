# Usability

## Maturity level 1

### Benefit

Software solution more closely aligns with an organization's processes

### Activity

Whether the process is momentary, ad hoc, or iterative, requirements gathering is a substantial part of software development. Requirements gathering alone is insufficient to create an application that accurately fits the needs of the people that use it. Usability testing and analysis helps bridge the gap between an solution that meets a set of requirements and a solution that meets the needs of the organization, people, and processes. This distinction is really between an solution that people want to use—i.e. one that has been usability tested—versus one they don't—i.e. one that simply meets a set of requirements. Poorly-designed applications can result in the loss of process information, the collection of incorrect or malformed data, and/or cause users to look for alternative means of performing their work outside the technology. Any of these issues may introduce risk into the organization or inhibit the diagnosis of a security event.

Even if all requirements are met during a development phase of a software solution, more valuable feedback is gained after it's used in a production environment. Survey the customers for feedback on how the product is working.

### Question

Do you have a formal feedback loop with your customers?

### Quality criteria

- You issue a survey about the application with the customer
- You use the results of the survey to refine the solution
- You perform this activity after every deployment

### Answers

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications

## Maturity level 2

### Benefit

The application conforms to the needs of the people using the solution

### Activity

Work with the customer to interview users of the software solution to find out their processes and pain points.

If the solution is internet connected, set up a direct feedback form from within the application. If possible, collect logs and analytics from the system.

Produce formal reports of these findings and review the analysis with the product teams.

### Question

Do you work to collect direct feedback from users and perform analysis on the findings?

### Quality criteria

- You work with the customer to talk directly to the users of the solution to find out what they do, their processes, how they use the system, what they appreciate about the tool, and what they feel could be added or improved
- You collect usage data directly from the system through logs or analytics
- You perform analysis of the information gathered and share it with the product team

### Answers

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications

## Maturity level 3

### Benefit

The application conforms to the users' behaviors and business processes

### Activity

Usability experts perform formal research on the business processes, the users' behaviors, and conduct usability studies with users interacting with a prototype or version of the software solution.

The usability experts develop formal reports on their findings and share them with the product teams.

### Question

Do you employ or contract with usability experts to perform usability testing and analysis?

### Quality criteria

- You employ or contract with usability experts
- You perform formal usability studies
- You integrate the findings of these studies into the product development

### Answers

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications
