# Accessibility

## Maturity level 1

### Benefit

Automated conformance to accessibility guidelines

### Activity

Accessibility is often overlooked as a development priority. It may be hard for developers without a disability to conceptualize needing or using accessibility features, but it's easy to find examples that may be possible for anyone to imagine. For example, some software developers developed repetitive stress injuries and turned to speech-to-text aids to continue working in their profession. Beyond the general necessity, adhering to accessibility standards is often a hard requirement for software solutions in many state systems.

Automated accessibility testing ensure conformance to the accessibility standards. The actual implementation often falls short of true accessibility; however, it is the first step.
