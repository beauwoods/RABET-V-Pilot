# Product Version Approval Methodology
When approval is given by the RABET-V reviewers, the provider is permitted to deploy their updates. It does not mean they have to, or that the customer has given them permission to. These deployments may be a website deploy, or a deployment to clients. 

## Publishing Report

What is in the report, what is publicized, what does it mean

## Provisional Approval
For product versions which require more extensive testing, the product may be given provisional approval while the more extensive testing is performed. Examples include
* When non-automated usability and accessibility testing is necessary, but the security testing is complete
* When the provider wants to update their security claims, and the security claim validation is going to take additional time.

When given provisional approval, the provider must maintain a way to revert back to the last approved version. 

## Post Approval Activities
In truth, RABET-V approval simply states that the product version has been reviewed. States and other election authorities will specify whether or not any post approval activities are required.
