# Security Claims Validation


## Security Claims Review
On Initial Submission or upon changes to the security claims...

The RABET-V Technical Guidance Committee will review the security claims and the expected usage to determine if the claims are enough 
We need to cover some expectations so this is not so subjective 
Do we require at least Level 1 for all applications? Some level 1 recommendations may be N/A – that is ok if the reason is justifiable.  
This may be another area for Technical Guidance  
We should definitely start by saying Level 1 is required – but change level 1 in the non-voting guide if necessary
