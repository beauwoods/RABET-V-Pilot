[NIST Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities by Adopting a Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/white-paper/2019/06/11/mitigating-risk-of-software-vulnerabilities-with-ssdf/draft)

## Process
The OWASP SAMM project makes a toolkit available. This [toolkit ](https://github.com/OWASP/samm/tree/master/Supporting%20Resources/v2.0/toolbox) provides an interview option for evaluating the provider's processes according to SAMM. Based on the answers, the toolkit will provide a maturity core for each Security Practice. 

## Open Questions

* How for the maturity scores translate to the treatment of future product changes?
