# Reporting Process
When approval is given by the RABET-V reviewers, the provider is permitted to deploy their updates. It does not mean they have to, or that the customer has given them permission to. These deployments may be a website deploy, or a deployment to clients. 

## Inputs

## Outputs

* Approval or Rejection Decision
* RABET-V Product (Revision) Report

## Workflow


## Decision Types

RABET-V produces a decision based on a current range of acceptable maturity scores. Scores are provided in the green range, yellow range, and red range. Systems with maturity scores in the green ranges receive full approval. Systems with some scores in the yellow range receive provisional approvals. Items with scores in all yellow or red will be rejected. The ranges are published and are subject to change. States may opt to publish their own acceptable scores or score ranges.

### Full Approval


### Provisional Approval

What are the rules for provisional approval. how long do they have to correct. what happens if scroes don't improve, etc.

## Post Approval Activities
In truth, RABET-V approval simply states that the product version has been reviewed. States and other election authorities will specify whether or not any post approval activities are required.
