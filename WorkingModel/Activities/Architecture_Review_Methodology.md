Validate important architecture aspects via inspection of system, code

Identify the critical, security providing code and the modules it is contained in (e.g. access control, data sanitization, input validation, data integrity, etc)

Identify interfaces and dependencies of the critical, security providing modules

Identify the critical data and the modules which handle the data (and their permissions)

Identify the 3rd party services or modules which are trusted

Assign labels of criticality to modules, interfaces, 3rd parties, and data
