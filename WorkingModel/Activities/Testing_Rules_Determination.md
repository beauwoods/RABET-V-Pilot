# Testing Rules Determination


To achieve the most change tolerant process possible given the product’s architecture, the RABET-V process creates product-specific verification procedures. For each requirement and each type of change, there will be specific verification methods prescribed for the product according to what can be justifiably assumed. In some cases, for well-defined architectures, the testing may be very little, automated, or deferred to the technology provider. This will be particularly true when the changes are small, limited in scope, and the technology provider’s process can produce meaningful artifacts. Testing scope and verification methods will change based on the type of changes submitted and how those changes mesh with the system architecture. Changes to interfaces between modules, for example, will be considered higher risk than changes within a module that do not impact its interfaces. Higher risks will yield greater testing scope and more intense verification methods. Portable software built on commercially supported platforms, for example, will be allowed to patch commercially supported elements with limited and automated testing. Systems with transparent software supply chains where updates and patches can be verified will be treated similarly. 
Once the process is established after the initial architecture and process review, future product version submissions will follow the rules established in the unique product verification process.
