# Product Verification Activity

The purpose of the product verification activity is to finalize the Security Services Capability Maturity (SSCM) scores based on the set of requirements. For some product changes, this activity will be streamlined because the changes were determined to pose a low risk to the current security capability scores. For other changes, this activity will be extensive in order to determine, or redetermine, the proper maturity scores. The risk is calculated in the Testing Rules which produces a Test Plan. 

## Inputs

* Product Revision deployed to test environment
* Product Development artifacts

## Outputs

* Results of verification test methods

## Workflow


### 1. Test Plan Generation

The Test Plan for the Product Verification activity is generated from the Testing Rules for the product. The Testing Rules are built in the Testing Rules Determination Activity and may be recently created or be existing rules from prior RABET-V iterations. 

The Testing Rules are a decision tree (or trees) where each change is processed by the tree and the end result is a verification method to use. This must be done for all changes and the Test Plan is the aggregation of all verification methods. 
 
### 2. Execute Test Plan

The Test Plan will identify how to test the product revision using one or more of the verification methods. Each verification method has its own workflow. 


## Verification Methods

As indicated in the Test Plan, the RABET-V reviewers will use one of more of the following techniques. The scope of the testing (i.e. which components to test) will also be indicated 

### Artifact Review


### Automated Review


### Functional Testing


### Integration Testing
