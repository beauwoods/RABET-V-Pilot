# RABET-V Working Model
RABET-V is a flexible, risk-based, and cost-effective election system verification process that will expedite verification of election systems while providing assurances of reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The RABET-V Pilot Program is designed to evaluate the RABET-V process and the potential of the process to improve the speed, security assurances, and cost-effectiveness of non-voting election technology verification. 
This Working Model describes RABET-V Process in detail. Along with this version of the Working Model, CIS is issuing two companion documents: (1) a Test Plan that describes how CIS intends to iterate and confirm that the framework proposed in this Working Model provides assurances of security, reliability, and usability for non-voting election technology products and (2) the Economic Framework for managing RABET-V post pilot.

## Introduction
### Program Goal
The goal is the program is to develop a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system for verifying the security of non-voting election systems. Verification will provide adequate assurances of reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Assurances are evidence-based grounds for confidence that the system’s features are effective in their application.
The RABET-V Program is intended to build stakeholder confidence that participating products and organizations have demonstrated capabilities to build, test, monitor, and maintain the reliability, usability, and security of their election technology solution. 

### Program Vision
RABET-V is designed to harness modern software development, testing, and deployment practices to produce a high confidence, more rapid, and less expensive process for verifying non-voting election systems. High confidence is achieved by providing evidence-based assurances of system reliability, usability, and security using evidence from developers where possible and independent testing where necessary.
* Use a risk-based methodology to verify non-voting election technology products in the most efficient manner.
* Allow for product changes in a quick and cost-effective way (i.e. change tolerance)
* Align verification of election systems with modern software development, testing, and deployment practices
* Provide evidence-based assurance of system reliability, usability, and security 
* Build on experience of similar industries, such as the medical device industry

### Program Scope
RABET-V is intended for non-voting election technology systems. An election technology system is an information system that supports an elections administration process. There are voting systems and non-voting systems. A “voting system” is defined in the Help American Vote Act (H.R. 3295, Sec 301) as “(1) the total combination of mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic equipment (including the software, firmware, and documentation required to program, control, and support the equipment) that is used—(A) to define ballots; (B) to cast and count votes;(C) to report or display election results; and (D) to maintain and produce any audit trail information; and (2) the practices and associated documentation used—(A) to identify system components and versions of such components;(B) to test the system during its development and maintenance; (C) to maintain records of system errors and defects; (D) to determine specific system changes to be made to a system after the initial qualification of the system; and (E) to make available any materials to the voter (such as notices, instructions, forms, or paper ballots).” A non-voting system is any other information system used during the election. Examples include voter registration databases, electronic pollbooks, or the websites of government election authorities.

## Guiding Framework
This Working Model is one approach to meeting the process described by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) in the RABET-V Framework. 
See [RABET-V Framework](RabetVFramework.md).

## Registered Technology Providers
The RABET-V Program is a continuous operation with participating technology providers known as Registered Technology Providers (RTPs). To be a RABET-V Registered Technology Provider, the technology provider must submit a complete RTP request, have at least one product verified by RABET-V, and agree to the RABET-V Program Committment. All current Registered Technology Providers will be listed on the RABET-V Program Portal. For the Pilot Program, each pilot participant will be considered an RTP. 

### Registered Technology Provider Request Package
Technology providers must submit a completed request package to become an RTP. A complete package will contain the following information: 
* Company Name, Legal Address, and Address(es) of all locations
* Point of Contact
* Website URL
* Company Description
* etc

### Program Committement

Technology providers who wish to remain RABET-V registered technology providers must agree to the RABET-V Program Committment. The committment establishes the ethical and responsible behavior expected by all program providers. The program committment is subject to change. The Committment includes:
* Accurate representation of the product capabilities and its security provisions to RABET-V reviewers, customers, and other stakeholders
* Continued education on and inclusion of cyber security best practices as an organization
* Continuous product maintenance, including the patching of components within reasonable timeframes
* Agree to transparency of their product expected usage and validated security claims

## Process Activity Descriptions
The RABET-V Process consist of seven activities, five of which are conditional.
