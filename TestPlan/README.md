# RABET-V Pilot Program Test Plan

The RABET-V Test Plan identifies how we will evaluate the RABET-V Process. We have identified the [research questions](Research_Questions.md) separately and outlined the process below. 

## Input
The RABET-V Test Plan begins with a completed version of the RABET-V Working Model. 

## Initial Interatiion

### Activity 1. Submission
CIS will work with pilot participant to complete the required documents for the initial submission. See [initial submission)[https://github.com/it-dept-cis/RABET-V-Pilot/blob/master/WorkingModel/Activities/Provider_Submission.md] for more details. Working sessions between CIS and the pilot participate will be done remotely. CIS will provide a way for the provider to send senstivie information securely. 

### Activity 2. Submission Review Process
CIS will conduct the submission review process along with its Technical Advisory Committee.

### Activity 3. Process Assessment
The process assessment will be conducted jointly by a member of the CIS team and a 3rd party evaluator. The 3rd party evaluator will be experienced with conducting process assessments. The process assessments will be done remotely over a 3-4 sessions with representatives from the pilot participant. There will be one process assessment per pilot participant.

### Activity 4. Architecture Review
There will be at least 2 architecture reviews conducted in isolation of each other for each pilot product. This approach will allow us to obtain independent results from different parties and different approaches. We will compare and merge the results. This activity will result in findings on which architecture review approaches or combination of approaches will work best. 

To allow for iterative improvements to the Working Model, architecture reviews will be done in serial and the working model will be updated in between iterations. 

### Activity 5. Security Claims Validation

### Activity 6. Testing Rules Determination

### Activity 7. Product Verification 

### Activity 8. Reporting
