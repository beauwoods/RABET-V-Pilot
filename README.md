# RABET-V Pilot Program

RABET-V is a flexible, risk-based, and cost-effective election system verification process that will expedite verification of election systems through providing assurances of reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The RABET-V Pilot Program is designed to evaluate the RABET-V process and the potential of the process to improve the speed, security assurances, and cost-effectiveness of non-voting election technology verification. 

## Steering Committee
The RABET-V Pilot Program is guided by a steering committee comprised of election officials, election technology providers, and other election infrastructure stakeholders.


## Pilot Process

The RABET-V Pilot Program will first establish a detailed version of the RABET-V process called the [RABET-V Working Model](WorkingModel). This version will detail the mechanics of the Pre-Market Review and Market Operation phases. The Working Model will be identify initial  Technical Guidance necessary to perform the architecture review and process assessment. The Working Model will be iteratively reviewed by the program steering committee and modified as necessary. 

From the Working Model, the Pilot Program will conduct Pre-Market Reviews. These will be conducted to allow for iterative changes in the Working Model between Pre-Market Reviews. These will be conducted on real products from Pilot Program participants that represent diverse offerings. The Pilot Program will work with pilot participants to develop their submission package and security claims. This pilot will then follow the architecture and process review technical guidance and develop risk-based product-specific testing processes. The Pilot Program will evaluate the value of the Pre-Market Reviews, along with the time and cost, and conclude with recommendations on the best approach. 

After the Pre-Market Reviews, the Pilot Program will evaluate one or more product versions from each of the pilot participants. This process will follow the testing of products assessed in the Pre-Market Review. This exercise will highlight the effectiveness of the Pre-Market Review to create meaningful but streamlined testing methods and help determine the effectiveness of the product architecture and process reviews. It will also provide useful time and cost information. After each verification iteration, changes may be made to the testing process and the iteration repeated as necessary.
